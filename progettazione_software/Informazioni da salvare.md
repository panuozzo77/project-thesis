**I. Core Book Identifiers (Essential for linking everything):**

*   From `goodreads_books.json`:
    *   `book_id`: Primary identifier for a specific book edition.
    *   `work_id`: Identifier for the conceptual "work" (a work can have multiple book editions). This is very important for grouping different versions/editions of the same conceptual book.
*   From `goodreads_book_works.json`:
    *   `work_id`: (Same as above, primary key here)
    *   `best_book_id`: Often points to the most popular or canonical `book_id` for a given `work_id`. Can be useful for display or as a representative edition.

**II. Book Metadata (for Content-Based Filtering & Display):**

*   From `goodreads_books.json`:
    *   `title`: The title of the book edition.
    *   `title_without_series`: Title excluding series information.
    *   `description`: Book summary/blurb. Crucial for NLP-based content features.
    *   `authors`: List of authors (specifically the `author_id` within each object in the list). This allows linking to author information.
    *   `publisher`: Publisher information.
    *   `language_code`: Language of the book.
    *   `num_pages`: Number of pages.
    *   `publication_year`, `publication_month`, `publication_day`: Publication date components.
    *   `series`: List of series this book belongs to (likely contains `series_id`).
    *   `popular_shelves`: User-generated tags/genres. Extremely valuable for understanding book content and user preferences. Each object in the list has a `name` (the shelf/tag) and `count`.
    **IV. General Popularity/Quality Indicators (can be used as features or for filtering):**
*   From `goodreads_books.json`:
    *   `average_rating`: Average rating for this book edition.
    *   `ratings_count`: Total number of ratings for this book edition.
    *   `text_reviews_count`: Number of text reviews for this book edition.
    * 
*   From `goodreads_book_works.json`:
    *   `original_title`: The title in its original language/publication.
    *   `original_publication_year`, `original_publication_month`, `original_publication_day`: Original publication date.
**IV. General Popularity/Quality Indicators (can be used as features or for filtering):**
*   From `goodreads_book_works.json`:

    *   `reviews_count`: Total reviews across all editions of this work.
    *   `text_reviews_count`: Total text reviews across all editions of this work.

    *   `ratings_count`: Total ratings for this work.
    *   `ratings_sum`: Sum of all ratings for this work (can be used with `ratings_count` to calculate average).
    
*   From `goodreads_book_authors.json` (to be linked via `author_id` from `goodreads_books.authors`):
    *   `author_id`: Primary key for an author.
    *   `name`: Author's name.
**IV. General Popularity/Quality Indicators (can be used as features or for filtering):**
*   From `goodreads_book_authors.json`:
    *   `average_rating`: Average rating for books by this author.
    *   `text_reviews_count`: Total text reviews for books by this author.
    *   `ratings_count`: Total ratings for books by this author.
    
*   From `goodreads_book_series.json` (to be linked via `series_id` from `goodreads_books.series`):

    *   `title`: Title of the series.

    *   `genres`: Dictionary of genres and their counts associated with the book. Very valuable explicit genre information.

**III. User-Interaction Data (for Collaborative Filtering, Hybrid Models & Personalization):**
*   From `goodreads_reviews_dedup.json`:
    *   `user_id`: Identifier for the user.
    *   `book_id`: Identifier for the book being reviewed (links to `goodreads_books.book_id`).
    *   `review_id`: Identifier for the review itself.
    *   `rating`: The numerical rating given by the user (e.g., 1-5 stars). **Crucial explicit feedback.**
    *   `review_text`: The textual content of the review. Highly valuable for sentiment analysis, topic modeling on reviews, and understanding nuanced user opinions.
    *   `date_added`: Date the review/book was added to a shelf.
    *   `date_updated`: Date the review/book was last updated.
    *   `read_at`: Date the user finished reading the book (if available).
    *   `started_at`: Date the user started reading the book (if available).
    *   `n_votes`: Number of votes the review received (can indicate review quality/helpfulness).
    *   `n_comments`: Number of comments on the review.



**Summary of Key Fields for Recommendation:**

1.  **Book Identifiers:** `book_id`, `work_id`
2.  **User Identifiers:** `user_id`
3.  **Core Interaction:** `user_id`, `book_id` (or `work_id`), `rating`
4.  **Content Features (Book):**
    *   `title` (and/or `original_title`)
    *   `description`

You will need to join data from these different "collections" (files) using their respective IDs (`book_id`, `work_id`, `author_id`, `series_id`) to build a comprehensive dataset for your recommendation model.
